# ipysettings

This package introduces a Python Settings class for holding generic
configuration data. The structure of the configuration data is specified using a
JSON Schema file, against which any input or change is validated. The Settings
class is also capable of creating a GUI to manipulate the configuration within a
Jupyter notebook.
